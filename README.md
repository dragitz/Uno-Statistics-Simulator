# Uno-Statistics-Simulator
 Simulate thousands of UNO games and get the result data in Json format


* May 12 2021

It is not finished yet and no simulation can be performed.

Right now the only thing that can be done is counting colors.

In the "Color Counter (test)" tab you can predict what cards a player has.

Check Wiki for more info on how to use it.

You can find the precompiled here: **/Uno Statistics Simulator/bin/Release/net5.0-windows/**

**TO DO:**

* Add game logic (aka place red cards only on top of red cards, ecc...)
* Add Ai (need logic and implement a risk factor)
* Fix bugs
